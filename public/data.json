    "I'm an average guy who likes nerdy things.",
    "Hello my name is Jonathan and I am a nerd. I like to write in almost any language but English; languages such as JavaScript, Java and C/C++ are some of my favorite. You can see some of my work by paroozing my GitHub repository.",
    "One of my other hobbies is electronics. At the age of 12 I built an digital analog clock out of TTL integrated circuits and tons of wire. I built it with instructions I found in a book at the library. My father helped me buy the parts and troubleshoot the bugs as I assembled it.",
    "I also enjoy doing things out side. During the winter months I snowboard down the ice slopes of New England; in the summer I can be found hiking many of the trails in the White Mountains. On occasion I run road races; 10k is about the longest I dare to go.",
    "I am also a fan of SyFy in all its forms: TV, moves, books and games. Both Star Wars and Star Trek are great but my favorite is Stargate; of the three I do believe that being able to generate a stable wormhole to a distant part of the universe is the most plausible."
